          "The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) of Pakistan is entering a new era of tax transparency and compliance with its latest directive, SRO 1771(I)/2023. The notification now requires real-time access to databases and information across a wide range of organizations, including financial institutions like commercial banks, government departments, and other private entities. This move is a significant stride in broadening Pakistanâ€™s tax base and clamping down on tax evasion. For instance, with organizations such as the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), and Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) under this ambit, FBR will have unprecedented insights into economic transactions. This integration allows for a more comprehensive understanding of financial activities across sectors, aiding in identifying potential tax evaders and non-filers."
